Neurorama is an open source, Creative Commons-licensed software to provide assets and binaries to aid in neuroanatomy and neuroscience education. Neurorama aims to make the job of learning neuroanatomy geometry and region functions more comprehendable and memorable through intuitive interactive models the student can explore at their own pace. Neurorama currently runs on desktop PCs, is built on Unreal Engine 4, and features VR compatability (Oculus Rift and HTC Vive) with or without motion controls. It uses the Brain for Blender made in association with the Mindboggle Project, utilizing the DTK cortex atlas.

The software is written in the UE4 Blueprints visual scripting language for ease of accessibility. The paradigm of game objects and functions is explained below.

BP_ia (InfoActors)
	infoActors are actors in the scene that contain a mesh and some information about what the mesh represents (used for parts of the brain and their descriptions).

BP_GameInstance

BP_PlayerController
	complex controller functions for all player pawns and game modes are stored here.
	manages "Diplay Modes," or the hiding of different parts of the brain upon player input. hidden infoActors are stored in an array here.

BP_Diorama_*
	Dioramas are collections of infoActors, and contain methods for retrieving and displaying infoActor information, passing it to the UI of the player's currently-possessed pawn.
