Neurorama is an open source, Creative Commons-licensed software to provide assets and binaries to aid in neuroanatomy and neuroscience education. Neurorama aims to make the job of learning neuroanatomy geometry and region functions more comprehendable and memorable through intuitive interactive models the student can explore at their own pace. Neurorama currently runs on desktop PCs, is built on Unreal Engine 4, and features VR compatability (Oculus Rift and HTC Vive) with or without motion controls. It uses the Brain for Blender made in association with the Mindboggle Project, utilizing the DTK cortex atlas.

The software is written in the UE4 Blueprints visual scripting language for ease of accessibility. The paradigm of game objects and functions is explained below.

This game utilizes Creative Commons assets from the Brain for Blender project (https://brainder.org/research/brain-for-blender/) as well as some public domain models from NASA (https://nasa3d.arc.nasa.gov/models).
